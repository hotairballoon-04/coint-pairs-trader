 abstract = {Let n observations Y1, Y2, ..., Yn be generated by the model Yt = ρ Yt - 1 + et, where Y0 is a fixed constant and {et}t = 1n is a sequence of independent normal random variables with mean 0 and variance σ2. Properties of the regression estimator of ρ are obtained under the assumption that ρ = ± 1. Representations for the limit distributions of the estimator of ρ and of the regression t test are derived. The estimator of ρ and the regression t test furnish methods of testing the hypothesis that ρ = 1.},
